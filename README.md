# Learning Elm

This repo contains [elm](https://elm-lang.org) programs I've written while
learning elm.   Each program is in it's own folder with a README.md describing
the program.  If I'm in a good mood I may even include details about the
program.

Why learn elm?

Why not?  I mean, what have you got to loose?  I'm learning elm because I've
had a fascination with functional programming languages for some time and
elm let's me hone my skills and make stuff that is shareable and possibly even
useful.
