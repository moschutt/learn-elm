# Dice

This is based on the example program from the [elm guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org)
which I highly recommend as a starting point for learning elm.  This program
is based on the example in the [Random](https://guide.elm-lang.org/effects/random.html)
section but extends is quite a bit adding a graphic die representation instead
of just a number using [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG)
and the ability to add and remove dice from the simulator.

dice.elm contains the elm source code for the program and dice.html is an
html page which can be used to run the program.  You can also use the elm
reactor or compile to the index.html.

I hope you find it interesting.  If you find any bugs or have any suggestions
please keep them to yourself.
